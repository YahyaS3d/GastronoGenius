### README

#### Description
This script implements a conversational retrieval system using the LangChain library. It leverages the OpenAI API for conversational responses and performs retrieval-based question answering.

#### Usage
1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install langchain openai`.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key by replacing `constants.APIKEY` with your actual API key.
3. Optionally, set the `PERSIST` variable to `True` if you want to save the index to disk for reuse.
4. Execute the script with an optional query argument, e.g., `python main.py "what is my favorite food?"`.
5. The script will prompt for input if no query argument is provided. Enter your query, and the system will respond with an answer.

#### Components
- **LangChain**: A library for natural language processing tasks.
- **OpenAI**: Provides the conversational model for generating responses.
- **VectorStoreIndexCreator**: Creates an index for efficient retrieval.
- **ConversationalRetrievalChain**: Combines the conversational model and retrieval index for interactive conversations.
- **DirectoryLoader**: Loads text data from a directory.
- **ChatOpenAI**: Model for conversational chat.
- **Chroma**: Vector store for storing and querying embeddings.

#### Notes
- Ensure proper setup of the OpenAI API key for authentication.
- Adjust the data directory and other configurations as needed.
- This script can be extended or integrated into larger conversational systems for various applications.
